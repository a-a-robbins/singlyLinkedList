# Creating Linked Lists
## Points: 25

## Submission
`commit` and `push` your code to the `master` branch on the remote GitHub repository **before** the deadline.

## Clone
`clone` this repo to repl.it or your local machine using the link provided on the GitHub repo page.

Use the included files as your template to start the program maintaining the filenames given.

## Running in Repl.it
The "Run" button should be configured; however, **it is NOT required**. This button is a "luxury", but on the off chance it does not work, you MUST compile and run the program manually using `gcc` to compile. Lack of usability of the "Run" button is not an valid excuse for not completing the assignment.

## Description
For this assignment you will perform several tasks:

- [ ] 1. Ask the user to enter in the number of nodes for the linked list
- [ ] 2. Generate a list with the # of nodes specified by the user
	* Each node will contain a random number with the range **0-9999**
- [ ] 3. Print out the generated list **(10 per line)**
- [ ] 4. Ask the user to enter in a number
	* Search the list and see if the number is in the list
- [ ] 5. If the number is in the list, change that node's value to a value specified by the user
	* print the list to verify that the specified node was changed
- [ ] 6. Search the list again for a value, if found, delete that node
	* print the list to verify that the node was deleted
- [ ] 7. Search the list and find out if there are any duplicate values in the list and print them out


### Required Functions
_*Functions that have a `P` are functions you are allowed to print in_

```c
/**
 * create a node for your list
 * return a pointer to that node (node *)
 */  
node *makeNode(int val);

/**
 * add a node to the front of the list
 * return new front of list
 */
node *insertFront(node *head, node *new);

/**
 * P: print out the linked list (10 per line)
 */
void printList(node *head);

/**
 * P: given a value, search the list and remove the node with that value
 */
node *deleteNode(node *head, int val);

/**
 * given a new and old value, search the list for the old value and change it to the new one
 */
node *modifyNode(node *head, int old, int new);

/**
 * given a value, searches the list for that value
 * return true or false (or an integer 0 or 1 that you can use as true or false)
 */
int inList(node *head, int val);

/**
 * P: search the linked list looking for any duplicate values in the list
 */
void lookForDupes(node *L);

/**
 * --Optional--
 * returns the number of nodes in a given list
 */
int length(node *L);
```
